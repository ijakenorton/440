How can you not run interupts? They are running on polling then?

So no progress is made due to the secondary processing being at a lower Interupt priority level?

"The queues between steps executed at different IPLs provide some insulation against packet losses
due to transient overloads, but typically they have fixed length limits."

NIC memory was the reason for this, needed to make sure that incoming packets were dealt with
quickly or the NIC would run out of memory
